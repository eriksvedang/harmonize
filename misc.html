<h1>Clairvoyance</h1>
Clairvoyance is a game where you try to guess the other player's move, kind of like a mixture between Rock-paper-scissors and Chess. Knowing what the other player think that you will do is as important as making a good move.

Design and programming by Erik Svedäng, art by Niklas Åkerblad, sound by Oscar Rydelius, additional programming by Johannes Gotlén.

<h1>Else Heartbreak</h1>
Sebastian has just landed his first job in the distant city of Dorisburg. He moves there to start his adult life and figure out who he really wants to be. Among a strange collection of people, hackers and activists he finds some true friends – perhaps even love. But can they stop the terrible deeds of the people ruling the city? And who will get their heart broken in the end?

A game where you explore a expansive 3D city to get to know the people of Dorisburg and unravel its mysteries.
